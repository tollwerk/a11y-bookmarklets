            <h1>Accessibility Testing Bookmarklets</h1>
            <p>The bookmarklets in this repository can help with auditing and testing a web application for
                accessibility
                issues. Some of them were heavily inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/pauljadam/bookmarklets">bookmarklets
                    by Paul J. Adam</a> but don't use external scripts and / or jQuery so they also do their job under
                restrictive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" rel="nofollow">CSP headers /
                    meta tags</a>. The bookmarklets marked with Ⓣ have been (re)written from scratch, the others
                were collected elsewhere (e.g. from the <a
                    href="https://www.bitvtest.de/bitv_test/das_testverfahren_im_detail/werkzeugliste.html#c1356">BIK
                    BITV test toolbox</a>, hence sometimes the German names) and slightly adapted. Where missing,
                documentation will be added over time.</p>
            <h2>Bookmarklets</h2>
            <ul>
                <!-- inject:bookmarklet -->
                <!-- endinject -->
            </ul>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>A bookmarklet is a small piece of (JavaScript) code that is run in the context of the currently visible
                web page.
                It comes as a bookmark that you typically add to your browser bookmarks for being able to run it
                repeatedly.
                In
                order to install one of the bookmarklets above,
                please drag its link to your browser bookmarks and call it from there.</p>
            <h2>Links to other bookmarklets</h2>
            <p>The following bookmarklets can also be very useful and are available in their original versions on the
                websites of their manufacturers:</p>
