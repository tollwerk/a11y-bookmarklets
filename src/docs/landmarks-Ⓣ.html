            <p class="hint">A bookmarklet is a small piece of (JavaScript) code that is run in the context of the
                currently visible
                web page.
                It comes as a bookmark that you typically add to your browser bookmarks for being able to run it
                repeatedly.
                In
                order to install this bookmarklet,
                please drag the link above to your browser bookmarks and call it from there. You can also click on the
                link to run the bookmarklet on this very page.</p>
            <h2>Purpose &amp; Notes</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this bookmarklet is to identify the presence of landmark regions in a document. Shadow
                DOMs are examined recursively.</p>
            <p>The results are displayed visually on the page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A green bubble (âœ”) indicates an proper landmark region.</li>
                <li>A red bubble (âœ–) indicates a landmark region which is missing an essential features, usually a
                    label.
                </li>
                <li>An orange bubble (ðŸ’€) indicates a landmark region which is missing a detail. Usually its label isn't
                    unique among the landmarks with the same role.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click on any of the info
                bubbles to log the associated element to the DevTools console.</p>
