                repeatedly.

            <h2>Purpose &amp; Notes</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this bookmarklet is to identify the presence of a document language setting as well as
                language settings for individual sections / phrases / words. Shadow DOMs are examined recursively.</p>
            <p>The results are displayed visually on the page:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A green bubble (✔) indicates a present language setting</li>
                <li>A red bubble (✖) indicates a missing document language setting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Click on any of the info
                bubbles to log the associated element to the DevTools console.</p>
